Go to use it the following Monday, and it won't start up. Gets stuck on a black screen with a flashing cursor. I've tried ALL of the troubleshooting options. I've tried a hard reset. I've contacted HP tech support through chat, tried all of the troubleshooting with them. Still not working. Called HP tech support tonight and tried more troubleshooting and another reset. Still nothing. So now I've had this thing for barely 2 months, it's unusable. And HP says I need to pay $40+ to have a flashdrive with the windows software loaded on it mailed to me because I don't have access to a different computer to download it to my own flashdrive and reinstall it on this computer even tho it's still within warranty but this is not covered.

The keyboard does have a bit of a grainy texture and feels plasticky on my nails, that bothers me but I'm getting used to it. Setup is a pain on windows 11, with a billion opt outs/ins for basically advertising. At least you can say no though so just pay attention to what they're asking during setup. :/Aside from that though, I'm really happy with the computer. It's fast. I turned off S mode in the settings under activation. S mode prevents you from downloading anything not Microsoft approved, including other browsers. Quite frankly, S mode is only good for controlling a child's downloads in my opinion, but I wouldn't force edge on even a child. LolI only bought this for writing but it's far exceeded my speed expectations and size is nice and big even though the laptop is extremely light. I haven't tried but I do think it could handle some light gaming.I would definitely recommend getting it.\n",
